Mondrian assignment{
In the class-wrap up assignment, I did some testings with mouseX, mouseY, random, frameRate and mousePressed, before watching and learning from the videoes. For the first work, I set the stroke color, rectengle roundness and location to link to mouse coordinate. This made the shapes move and change with the movement of the mouse. And made the work "playable" by moving the mouse to form the original painting. 
For the second work, I tested random code and mouseX&Y. Therefore, the color of the shapes are always changing. Besides, I change the order of background, so the background will only be drown once. This makes the painting interactable that viewers can paint on the canvas by moving the mouse. In addition, there's a mousePressed code. So when mouse is pressed, the canvas will be reset.

Animation & Variables{
In this assignment about balls' animation. I work on the codes that I did during class, therefore the balls are now moving vertically. The other thing I changed is the color of the balls will change according to their location. Howeverm, I found that the range of RGB color system is only 0 to 255, but the canvas is 400 x 400. So the color will stop changing in the middle of the canvas. So far my ability only allows me to change the size of the canvas smaller so the color will keeping changing in the whole bouncing process.

HSB{
In this assignment, I experiemented with the HSB system. To change HSB to RGB, I need to change the range from 400 to 255. Due to the difference in these two system, the coloring outcome of this code is different. For the variables, changing the names of them won't change any thing. To my understanding, the naming is just making it easier for human to read. The meaning of the names are set by the let code.
